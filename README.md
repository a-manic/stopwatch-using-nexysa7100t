# stopwatch-using-nexysa7100t

This project implements a functional stopwatch that displays on the 8 seven segment displays available, and is controlled by three buttons on the Nexys A7 100T.

The Schematic of the system for this project was built on Vivado, and the coding and interface to board were done on Xilinx using Embedded C.
